                for (int j = 0; j < tokens.length; j++) {
                    System.out.println("..............");

                    if (tokens[j].startsWith(flagKey1) || tokens[j].startsWith(flagKey2)) {

                Certainly! The Haversine formula has some fascinating aspects and interesting applications. Here are some cool facts and tidbits about it:

1. Historical Significance:
   - The term "haversine" comes from the function "half-versed-sine" used in navigation calculations since the 18th century.
   - It was particularly important in celestial navigation before the advent of modern technology.

2. Computational Efficiency:
   - Before calculators and computers, the haversine formula was easier to compute by hand than other spherical distance formulas, making it valuable for navigators.

3. Space Applications:
   - NASA has used variations of the Haversine formula for calculating distances on Mars and other celestial bodies.

4. Geofencing:
   - It's crucial in modern geofencing applications, helping determine if a point is within a certain radius of another point.

5. Aviation:
   - Pilots use it (often through onboard computers) to calculate Great Circle routes, which are the shortest path between two points on a sphere.

6. Vincenty's Formulae:
   - For even more precise calculations, especially over longer distances, Vincenty's formulae are used, which are an extension of the Haversine formula that accounts for the ellipsoidal shape of the Earth.

7. Underwater Navigation:
   - Submarine navigation systems use variations of this formula for precise underwater positioning.

8. Astronomy:
   - It's used in astronomy to calculate angular distances between celestial objects.

9. Sports Analytics:
   - In sports like soccer or American football, it's used to calculate the distance covered by players during a match.

10. Geocaching:
    - The popular outdoor recreational activity of geocaching relies heavily on Haversine calculations for distance and direction.

11. Mathematical Beauty:
    - It's considered elegant in mathematical circles because it solves a complex 3D problem (distance on a sphere) using a relatively simple 2D formula.

12. Error at Poles:
    - The formula can produce errors for points near the Earth's poles due to the convergence of longitude lines, leading to interesting edge cases in programming.

13. Mobile Game Development:
    - Many location-based mobile games use this formula to calculate distances between players or game objects.

14. Optimization Challenges:
    - Implementing the Haversine formula efficiently in computer systems presents interesting optimization challenges, especially for high-volume calculations.

15. Cross-Disciplinary Nature:
    - It beautifully combines trigonometry, geography, and computational mathematics, making it a great example of cross-disciplinary application in science.

These aspects showcase how a relatively simple mathematical formula can have wide-ranging applications and historical significance across various fields.
